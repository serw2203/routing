##Used
- [npm][0] : package manager for JavaScript. Find, share, and reuse packages of code from hundreds of thousands of developers — and assemble them in powerful new ways 
- [bower][1] : package manager for the web. Web sites are made of lots of things — frameworks, libraries, assets, and utilities. Bower manages all these things for you  
- [gulp][2] : JavaScript task runner that lets you automate tasks such as:
```
- bundling and minifying libraries and stylesheets.
- refreshing your browser when you save a file.
- quickly running unit tests
- running code analysis
- Less/Sass to CSS compilation
- copying modified files to an output directory
```        
- [babel][3] : JavaScript compiler for writing next generation JavaScript such as ES2015, react ...
- [superagent][4] : small progressive client-side HTTP request library, and Node.js module with the same API, sporting many high-level HTTP client features
- [browserify][5] : will recursively analyze all the require() calls in your app in order to build a bundle you can serve up to the browser in a single &lt;script&gt; tag.
- [babelify][6] : Browserify transform for Babel
- [vinyl-source-stream][7] : conventional text streams at the start of your gulp or vinyl pipelines. See [vinil][7.1]
- [history] : supports the HTML5 History/State APIs (pushState, replaceState, onPopState) in all browsers
